# ⏱️ Pomodoro Timer App

A simple and elegant **Pomodoro Timer** built using Python and Tkinter.

This app helps you stay focused using the Pomodoro technique — 25 minutes of work,
followed by short and long breaks.
Designed with a clean UI using the `Canvas` widget to display a background image and dynamic timer text.

## One session = work + short break

## Here , I consider

## Work Session =25 minutes
# short_break = 5 minutes
# long_break = 20 minutes

## After last session, ie completion of 4 th session , long break timer starts
## 🚀 Features

- Start and Reset buttons
- Work, short break, and long break sessions
- Visual checkmarks for completed Pomodoros
- Fully responsive timer using `after()` method in Tkinter
